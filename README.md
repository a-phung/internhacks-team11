## General info
FairView is a project run by a group of enthusiastic college students offering a tool to help Machine Language Practitioners and Data Researchers to gain deeper insights into their demographic metadata and realize possible bias/unfairness. 

With our tools, view the distribution of your metadataâ€™s available demographic attributes, including distribution of age, race, education, and income data. 

We also help uncover issues such as the most and least dominant feature values, missing values for a large number of observations. 

We believe sharing comprehensible and easily accessible information can help bring awareness and understanding to how to apply these practices in your ML algorithmic bias detection and mitigation.
